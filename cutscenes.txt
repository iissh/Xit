Jovi: "Okay then, how do we get out... alive?"
Voice: "It's simple! Just win the game. Winners also win $1 000 000 each and a vacation bundle for three nights to stay in Bali!"

Win the entire game?
That's easier said than done.
How were we supposed to win against everyone else?

Lucas: "How many players are participating in this game?"
Voice: "996 players at the moment but now with the addition of you four, we'll have 1000."
Mateo: "You expect us to triumph over 1000 players to live? That's bull."
Voice: "Sometimes you have to do things that you do not expect. This situation could have been avoided if you read the Terms and Conditions of the game before loading yourselves into it."
Lucas: "300 pages of irrelevant text? No one is going to read that."
Voice: "That is your fault, not mine. Now my time is up, good luck to all of you!"

Before anyone could say anything, the mysterious announcer disappeared and we were transported into an endless flat field of grass.
There was nothing to be seen in the distance, just grass.
I looked into the in-game menu and saw several interested options; missions, inventory, map, and Avatar profile.
I clicked on the personal stats option and it opened a new window with my stats written down.

Looks like I need to work on building speed, strength, and weapon skill if I want a chance to survive.
I closed the avatar profile window and clicked on the map window.

Seems like there are two possible towns we can go to at the moment. North of us is Archensheen and south is Fallholt.
I closed the map window and expanded the inventory window.

I also need to collect more resources and weapons.
It seems that I have have twin daggers though.
Perfect for an assassin class player like me.

Me: "Do you guys have daggers as well?"
Lucas: "No, it seems that my class is Tank so I've got an axe."
Mateo: "I have a rifle! Looks like I'm the team ADC (attack-damage-carry)."
Me: "Haha, that's perfect for you two. Brother Duo."
Jovi: "Seems like I'm the last one."
Me: "What do you have J?"
Jovi: "I have a Katana which probably means I'm in the fighter class. Assassins and Fighters go well together don't they?"

Jovi turns towards me and winks slyly.
I can feel my face turn red and I start to stutter.

Me: "Y-yeah for sure"
Jovi: "Haha, classic El."
Lucas: "Guys, check out your missions tab, I think we've gotta do this..."

I open my in-game menu and select the missions tab.

 _______________________________________________
| MISSION 1: Find a fifth squad member (support) |
 _______________________________________________


Lucas: "I think we are going to need a fifth member if we want to be eligible to compete with a fair advantage."
Mateo: "Where are we supposed to find that??"
Jovi: "I think one of the towns on the map might lead us there."
Lucas: "Hey El, what town do you think we should check first?"

There doesn't seem to be any hints as to where we could check.
I think we should go with...
[1] Archensheen
[2] Fallholt

Lucas: "Archensheen here we are"
Mateo: "Let's start looking for a member, preferably a support."

We searched and searched for a couple of hours.
We were hungry so we decided to stop by a cafe to fill ourselves up.
In the far-right corner, I saw a girl with a top-hat sitting by herself sipping on a drink and reading a novel.
I decided to go up to her and ask her to join the team.

Me: "Hey, I was wondering if you had a squad already?"
Girl: "No, I don't."
Me: "Could you tell me what class you are?"
Girl: "I'm a support."

That's perfect. We need a support on our team!

Me: "Would you like to join my squad?"
Girl: "I would love to! My name is C4mi!"
Me: "Nice to meet you! I'm El."

I helped Cami collect her belongings and we walked over to the table with the boys.

Me: "These are the rest of my friends, Mateo, Lucas and Jovi."
Cami: "Nice to meet you all! My name is Cami, I'm of support class."
Mateo: "Hey Cami, I'm glad you joined us!"
Lucas: "Yeah, we can start the game now!"

We continued talking for a bit while we finished our food.
Cami is really getting along with the others, I'm glad she was able to fit in easily.
I opened the in-game menu and checked the missions tab.
The first mission was checked-off now that we had Cami on our team and a new mission appeared. 

 ________________________________________________
| MISSION 2: Find the Key to access the PvP Zone |
 ________________________________________________

There appears to be a gate to enter the PvP zone and we need a key to access it. 

Me: "Don't get your hopes up guys. We still need a key to get to the PvP Zone.”
Lucas: "Whaaat, are you for real?"
Me: "Yes Lucas, now let's go find the key!"

We paid for the food and embarked on our journey once again.

Jovi: "Which town is it this time El?"

I think we should go to...
[1] Archensheen
[2] Fallholt

I think we should go to Fallholt.
Jovi: "That's gonna be our destination!"

We walk for about eight hours until we get to our destination.

Lucas: "Fallholt here we are!"
Mateo: "Let's start searching for that key."
Cami: "Actually I might be able to help here. My healing staff can sense objects with bloodlust aura on them."
Lucas: "OH that's really neat! Let's see it!"
Cami: "Here goes!"

Cami points her staff in the sky and a bright flash quickly occurs. 
After a few moments the light fades away and Cami brings her staff down.

Cami: "Follow me, I know where it is."

We all follow Cami and she brings us to an old worn down shack.
Inside there is furniture all thrown everywhere and bugs infesting the house.

Cami: "It's under than chair in cabinet's third drawer."
Mateo: "Do we just have to get it? That should be easy!"
Cami: "Wait be careful don't go in. Those insects are extremely dangerous, they will be able to devour you in less than 5 seconds."
Mateo: "Really? They don't seem that harmful."
Cami: "They are though. Let me summon this protective barrier on you before you go in. This should protect you from making contact with those bugs."

Cami summons the barrier on Mateo and he goes inside the shack to retrieve the key.
A few minutes later he comes back out.

Mateo: "You sure are right about those bugs. Inside I found a dozen more corpses with insects swarming all over them."
Cami: "Told ya so!"
Mateo: "Thanks Cami! Now we've got the key guys so what's our next destination?"
Jovi: "It’s almost 22:00. I think we should get dinner and some rest and head out again tomorrow."
Lucas: "I agree, I'm pretty tired from all that we’ve done."
Cami: "Same here let's rest. There is actually a hotel nearby. We should be able to get there by 22:25 if we start walking now."
Me: "Well what are we waiting for? Let's go."

On the trip to the hotel Cami told us a lot about the game and how to defeat it.
Apparently when we enter the gate we would have to train so raise our avatar stats or else we would get defeated at the stages.
The plan for tomorrow was for us to start training so we could all get through the stages.
After 25 minutes of walking, we arrived at the hotel.

Hotel Lobby Secretary: "Welcome to Fallholt Lounge, the best hotel in Fallholt town. How may we help you today?"
Cami: "How many beds come in each room?"
Hotel Lobby Secretary: "Two beds in each room."
Cami: "How many rooms should we get?"
Jovi: "I think we'll need three then."
Hotel Lobby Secretary: "Three rooms it is, here are the cards. Enjoy your stay!"

Our rooms were on the seventeenth floor, when we got there we decided to split rooms.

Mateo: "Me and Lucas call dibs on this room!"

Mateo and Lucas ran off to their room.
Now it was just Jovi, Cami, and me.
I will have to room with one of them but who should I choose?

I'd rather room with...
[1] Cami
[2] Jovi

Mateo: "Looks like we need to North to get to the PvP Zone".
Cami: "Well what are we waiting for? Let's go!"

The five of us embarked on a hike towards the PvP Zone.
After several hours we arrived at our destination.
A tall ghost like figure appeared in front of us.

Ghost: "Welcome to the PvP Zone. The only way to exit the game."
Lucas: "How do we get out?"
Ghost: "You must gain enough stats and become victorious in the X/it PvP Tournament. The winning squad gets riches and the ability to leave the game!"
Mateo: "How do we acquire the stats?"
Ghost: "In your PvP Menu you should be able to access everything you need. Goodluck!"

The ghost vanished and left us.

Cami: "Looks like we are going to have to start training"
Jovi: "You sure are right about that."

Everyone opened their menus and started training.
Looks like it was time to get serious. 
We all agreed on meeting up when we had enough skill again at the X/it Tournament.
Let's do this!
